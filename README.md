# SQL
Introduction to Databases Elective class at San Francisco State University. Includes queries assigned as homework. 
Topics: ER diagrams, SQL, SQLite, tree indices, hash-based indices and 5+ more topics. 

### Overview  
Individual homework on SQL queries contain around 15 queries, that was written and tested during an Introduction to Databases elective course at San Francisco State University. The database system used was SQLite. For the specific homework assignments uploaded in this repository, there is no programming in C and Java, even though we had two assignments with that expectation.
