# SQL
Introduction to Databases Elective class at San Francisco State University. Includes queries assigned as homework. 
Topics: ER diagrams, SQL, SQLite, tree indices, hash-based indices and 5+ more topics. 

### Overview  
The homework file contains around 15 SQL queries, that was written and tested during an Introduction to Databases elective course at San Francisco State University. The database system used was SQLite. For the specific homework assignments uploaded in this repository, there is no programming in C and Java, even though we had two assignments with that expectation. 

During a separate class called Software Engineering, MySQL Workbench was used together with PHP, to integrate the MySQL database with generic and common PHP forms. We were a team of 4 people working on an e-commerce website the entire semester. Part of it was to use the MVC design pattern, so the database behavior was organized in our controller class.
